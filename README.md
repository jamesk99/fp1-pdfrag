# Project: FP1-PDFRAG
A Local RAG System, with private pdf upload.

This is a local rag system which enables the user to locally access documents and interact with their contents in a secure and smooth manner. The local system makes use of generative AI technologies to provide its user with a local solution, which can be especially useful when working with documents that may contain sensitive information or other proprietary data which could be a security breach if uploaded to a nonlocal AI system.

The sytem is accessed through the user's terminal, and the codebase can be found under "RAG System".

Test documents can be found under "Data\raw" and are useful for testing the system and establishing a foothold into the capabilities of having a local AI system.
